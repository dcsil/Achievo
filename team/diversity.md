Diversity
---

Diversity is an integral part of our company and our vision. As we acknowledge that our product will serve a wide range of students across cultures, academic systems, and personal circumstances, to design an inclusive and impactful product, we must first reflect on the diversity and expertise of our own team, acknowledge our limitations, and proactively plan for ways to address them.


Team Background & Strengths
---

Our team brings a diverse background to the table. While we were all raised in Canada, our ethnic backgrounds span multiple countries in Asia. Collectively, we speak four languages, reflecting our varying cultural backgrounds and upbringings. Growing up in Asian households, we were instilled with a strong emphasis on academics and value of education from an early age. This foundation has driven us to pursue multiple commitments and responsibilities, even throughout our post-secondary journeys. As students ourselves, the intended users of the product, we bring firsthand insight into the very challenges we aim to solve, allowing us to design with authenticity and empathy.

In terms of our skills individually:

As a result, our strengths complement each other, which based on our diverse backgrounds will help strengthen our team. 


## Weak Spots

Despite our teamâ€™s strong technical and cultural backgrounds, we recognize that there are some areas where we may face limitations. While we bring insights from our experiences as Canadian students, our perspective is still narrow, since it mainly reflects the experiences of students in North America. This may create gaps in understanding the needs of international students or those outside traditional university settings. 

In terms of technical expertise, while we are well-rounded in AI, full-stack development, and data analysis, our team has limited experience in Chrome extension development, which is a core area for our product since students often rely on web platforms to access Canvas, and productivity and wellness tools. Additionally, we do not have formal training in psychology or mental health, which could make it difficult to address sensitive wellness needs responsibly.

We recognize that our shared backgrounds may introduce unconscious bias into our design, such as assuming students have equal access to technology, focusing too heavily on North American education systems, or oversimplifying mental health challenges based on personal experiences. 


### Subject Matter Experts

As students, we lack the perspective of educators or counselors who guide and help students with organizational or mental health related troubles. They would provide additional insight on their experiences of solutions that worked for students. As well, because we want to incorporate a gamification element, we may contact professionals in psychology to ask for their advice on how to best gamify our product. Lastly, as a team of 5 students, we are too small of a sample size to accurately predict the needs of the entire North American student population. So, we will reach out to more students through surveys to gather more research.

## Customer Diversity

While our team brings a strong mix of technical skills, we recognize that our collective experiences may not fully reflect the diversity of the broader student population. Our current perspectives, while valuable, may unintentionally limit our understanding of the wide challenges faced by students from different cultural, socio-economic, or neurodiverse backgrounds. Additionally, as a team of abled individuals, we may overlook important accessibility needs and lived experiences of students with disabilities. Despite these limitations, we are committed to building an inclusive and supportive product. To ensure our solution meets the needs of all students, we plan to actively diversify our user research and testing by engaging individuals with varying backgrounds, learning styles, and accessibility considerations. This approach will help us identify blind spots and design a tool that better supports the full range of student experiences.


### How this can impact us

It is important for an education tool to be inclusive and accessible to diverse learners. Without inclusivity, the product risks losing credibility and trust, as users may perceive it as biased or limited in scope. We acknowledge that our team may lack certain perspectives, which could create gaps in how effectively we address different learner needs. To mitigate this, we actively seek feedback from subject matter experts and customers, using their input to continuously refine and improve the product.
