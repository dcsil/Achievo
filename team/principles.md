# Team Principals 

## Communication 
- Team members will mainly communicate using a Discord Server. It will be our base for any information, updates and emergencies we have.
- In case of emergency, we have the group’s collected phone numbers pinned in a channel for texting and calling. 

## Meetings
- We will adopt a hybrid approach to meetings. Regular meetings are Tuesdays 6-7 PM in person in either Bahen or Robarts, and Sundays 1–2 PM on Discord. Extra meetings will be scheduled as needed, in person or online, based on availability.
- ​Members must attend team meetings or notify others if absent, arrange for someone to cover or share updates, and catch up on missed discussions and tasks.

## Work
- We are all there to support each other on the work involved for this course.
- We will try our best to delegate work evenly during our team meetings. This delegated work will be recorded on GitHub issues and/or sent in our Discord server.
- We will complete work on time and communicate if we need help.

## Decision-making
- Decisions should be made collaboratively whenever possible, through group discussion either in-person or over call
- If consensus cannot be reached, we will proceed with a majority vote. 

## Accountability & Deadlines
- Members are expected to complete assigned work on time.
- If unable, they must notify the team early so tasks can be re-delegated.
- All tasks will be tracked in GitHub, Google Drive, and Discord with clear ownership and deadlines for transparency.
- Progress updates should be shared regularly (via Discord or in meetings).
- We commit to a blameless culture — delays will be addressed collaboratively, not through individual blame.
-  Repeated missed deadlines or lack of communication will first be reminded, then discussed as a group, and escalated if necessary.
- Work is considered “done” only when all requirements are met, standards followed, and (for larger tasks) reviewed and approved by another member.

## Feedback & Conflict Resolution
- Feedback should be specific and constructive
-  The team members could also reflect periodically after each milestone on what’s working well & what can be improved as a group

## Quality Standards
- Agreeing on coding or documentation standards, such as naming conventions, formatting, function headers, etc. 
- For larger changes, aim to have code reviewed before merging.
- Ensuring clear communication on who’s contributing to a shared body of code/file, to avoid merge conflicts.


##  Time Commitment & Workload
- Including meeting times, we estimate around 3-5 hours per week, on average per team member. This will change depending on the deliverables and milestones in a given week.

## Other issues:
- We cannot foresee every kind of issue that might arise; however, the team is committed to coming up with a plan to overcome roadblocks of any kind through shared communication on how to handle the issue.
