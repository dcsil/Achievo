## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m Anushka, a 5th year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. I have strong experience in full-stack web development and data engineering, with projects ranging from dynamic dashboards and task management apps to scalable data pipelines using BigQuery, Airflow, and Terraform. Beyond academics and work, I love listening to music & exploring different coffee shops around the city! I  also love  cats.

## Strengths

- Full-stack development and data engineering skills
- Strong problem-solving and adaptability in technical environments
- Clear communication and ability to work independently or with stakeholders

## Weaknesses

- Public speaking and presenting to large groups can be a challenge
- Can get caught up in details and spend too long perfecting solutions
-  Sometimes take on too many projects at once
