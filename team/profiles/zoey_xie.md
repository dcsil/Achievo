## About Me

Hi! I'm Zoey, a 4th year student studying Computer Science. On the technical and professional side, I have experience in full stack development, specifically with React and Typescript. I've also worked with databases and have dabbled in data analysis. I have a background in consulting and workflow management as well. In my personal time, I love watching food videos and am also a fencer on the university team!

## Strengths

- Adaptibility and quick learning
- Software development practices and knowledge -- but is still learning!
- Communication and client understanding

## Weaknesses

- Taking on too many things at once
- Organization
- Getting overwhelmed if there are too many things going on at once (the intersection of the first two)
