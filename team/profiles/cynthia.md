## About Me

Hi! I’m Cynthia, a 4th year student at the University of Toronto pursuing a double specialist in Computer Science and Data Science. I have experience in software development and data analysis, including an internship at Amazon and projects in iOS app development and web development. Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring different kinds of food and I’m a big fan of bubble tea.

## Strengths

- AI (prompt engineering)
- Data analysis and visualization
- Problem Solving

## Weaknesses

- Frontend development
- Organization (can sometimes spend too much time fine-tuning details)
