# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines our plan for building a Chrome extension that helps students organize their schedules, sync assignments from Canvas, and stay engaged through gamification. It is structured into short term (next month), medium term (1–6 months), and long term (6+ months) goals. The roadmap highlights overall outcomes, while detailed tasks are tracked as GitHub Issues.

## Short Term

**Duration:** Q4 2025

**Target Completion Date:** 10/31/2025

Goal: Deliver a functional MVP that lets users upload a syllabus, set preferences, and view a basic schedule with gamification.
- Build the core extension scaffold (Chrome MV3, TypeScript) and backend service (Flask + Databricks SQL Warehouse).
- Provide basic onboarding: landing page, quiz for study habits, and syllabus upload.
- Implement task list + schedule view generated from syllabus data.
- Enable basic gamification: mark tasks as done to earn coins.
- Establish infrastructure: tech stack decisions, CRUD APIs, Postman testing, database schema, and work delegation.
- Conduct 3–5 user interviews to validate core functionalities and refine priorities.

## Medium Term

**Duration:** Q4 2025 - Q1 2026

**Target Completion Date:** 3/31/2026

Goal: Evolve from MVP into an alpha product with scheduling, personalization, and Canvas integration.
- Add calendar view, enhanced home page, and profile updates.
- Introduce rewards system: collection and store for coin spending.
- Launch core features: Canvas sync with assignment submissions, preference updates, .ics export, notifications, and multi-syllabus support.
- Enable AI-driven task breakdown with micro-deadlines and break suggestions.
- Expand authentication to support multiple users (login/signup).
- Add filter/sort functionality to schedules.
- Strengthen testing coverage to 90% for backend and frontend.
- User Research: Usability testing of calendar, Canvas sync, and notifications.
- Low-fidelity launch: Release an alpha version in the Chrome Web Store beta channel at the beginning of the winter semester

## Long Term

**Duration:** Q2 2026 - Q3 2026

**Target Completion Date:** 8/1/2026

Goal: Scale the product with advanced features, analytics, and integrations for a full launch.
- Add UI polish and animations for gamification and smoother experience.
- Build analytics dashboard: track task completion rates, streaks, and on-time submissions.
- Support external calendar integrations (Google Calendar, Outlook).
- Implement predictive scheduling: AI-driven study block recommendations.
- Develop advanced notifications: tiered reminders and personalized nudges.
- Public launch: Move from beta → full release on the Chrome Web Store, with marketing emphasis on Canvas sync as a differentiator at the beginning of the 2026 school year.
