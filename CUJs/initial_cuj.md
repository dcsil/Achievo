## Summary of Findings
This section should concisely answer:
- What is it?
- What does it do?
- Why does it matter?

### User Goal
As a software developer/database engineer, I want to test how text data can be stored in our database, so that I can ensure any given dataset is correctly saved and retrievable.

**Highlights and Lowlights Table**:
| Task | Experience | Notes |
|:------|:------------|:------|
| Local setup + development | Severe | Understanding how to navigate Databricks as first-time users, doing our research and figuring out how to connect to Python on a local app. We ran into some errors while connecting Databricks with our local app, such as [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed error, which was difficult to debug |
| View Result | Great | Being able to see our test data in a database and be able to easily query it using SQL. |
| Permission Set up | Severe | Grant permission to others requires a lot of manual steps for the administrator |
| Debug | Great | AI assistant is helpful + a lot of documentation online |

**Product Recommendations**: 
Perhaps providing a more detailed section on setting up Databricks for a project for first-time users, particularly regarding how to address issues that we may run into, such as python version compatibility with databricks connector library, as well as how how fix specific errors such as `[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED]` error, which is something we ran into multiple times. 

**Recommendations for Future Users**:
If running into errors on the Databricks UI, be sure ...
